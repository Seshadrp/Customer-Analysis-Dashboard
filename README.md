# Customer-Analysis-Dashboard

I recently created this **Customer Analysis Dashboard**, designed to provide actionable insights into revenue trends, customer demographics, and sales performance. This project helped me strengthen my data visualization and analytics skills while exploring how to present complex data in an intuitive way.

## Key Features:
- **Revenue Trends**: Visualizing monthly revenue fluctuations and identifying peak-performing months.
- **Geographical Insights**: Revenue distribution across states and regions, highlighting key markets.
- **Demographic Analysis**: Insights into revenue contributions by age groups and gender.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationship between discounts and order quantities.

This dashboard showcases my ability to analyze and present data using tools like **Tableau** and demonstrates my focus on delivering meaningful insights for data-driven decision-making.
